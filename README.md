This repository was used for a Hackathon project called StudentLife.
It is the winning entry in a hackathon organized by the Electrical Engineering Students' European Association (EESTEC LC) for the "Innovation challenge" category. 

The hackathon began on December 21, 2019, it lasted for 24 hours and the goal was to come up with a website that would make the life of students easier and implement a prototype. A video of the app can be checked at the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a7ta8ld5K6hlEtCvRrOf_cpGe86inVM6/view?usp=sharing).
